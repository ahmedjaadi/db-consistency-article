= Database Consistency Demo

This project demonstrates database consistency issues and solutions in distributed systems using Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Kafka.

== Overview

This application showcases different database consistency scenarios:

. *Repeatable Read Isolation Level*: Demonstrates how the REPEATABLE_READ isolation level ensures consistent reads within a transaction.
. *Pagination Issues*: Shows problems that can occur when paginating through data that's being modified concurrently, and a solution to fix it.

The application uses:

* Spring Boot 3.4.1
* Java 21 (with Virtual Threads)
* PostgreSQL
* Apache Kafka
* Spring Data JPA
* Spring Web

== Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need:

* Docker and Docker Compose
* JDK 21
* Gradle (or use the included Gradle wrapper)

== Setup and Running

=== Building the Application

. Clone the repository
. Build the application:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean build
----

=== Running with Docker Compose

The project includes a Docker Compose configuration that sets up:

* PostgreSQL database
* Kafka and Zookeeper
* Two instances of the application

IMPORTANT: Before starting the services, ensure the database initialization script is executable:

[source,bash]
----
chmod +x scripts/data.sh
----

This is critical because the script is mounted as a volume in the PostgreSQL container and must be executable for the container to initialize the database properly.

To start all services:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up -d
----

This will:

. Start PostgreSQL and initialize it with sample data (5000 sales records)
. Start Kafka and Zookeeper
. Start two instances of the application on ports 8080 and 8081

=== Accessing the Application

The application exposes REST endpoints on:

* http://localhost:8080 (first instance)
* http://localhost:8081 (second instance)

== Using the Application

=== API Endpoints

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Endpoint |Description

|`POST /repeatable-read`
|Demonstrates the repeatable read isolation level. Processes sales with NOT_INITIALIZED status and sends events to Kafka.

|`POST /pagination-zero`
|Shows a pagination issue when processing data that's being modified concurrently.

|`POST /pagination-zero-fixed`
|Shows a fixed version of the pagination issue by adding a small delay between iterations.

|`GET /status-count`
|Returns counts of sales by status.

|`GET /elapsed-time`
|Returns the total time elapsed for processing.

|`GET /sales`
|Returns a paginated list of all sales. Supports standard Spring pagination parameters (`page`, `size`, `sort`).

|`POST /reset`
|Resets all sales to "NOT_INITIALIZED" status.
|===

=== Example Usage

. Reset the database to _the_ initial state:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/reset
----

. Check the current status counts:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/status-count
----

. Run the repeatable read experiment:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/repeatable-read
----

. Check the status counts again to see the changes:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/status-count
----

. Reset and try the pagination experiment:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/reset
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/pagination-zero
----

. Compare with the fixed pagination approach:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/reset
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/pagination-zero-fixed
----

. View the elapsed time for processing:

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/elapsed-time
----

== Stopping the Application

To stop all services:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose down
----

To stop and remove all data (volumes):

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose down -v
----
